# High level design

Behaviour 

Accident detection using convolution neural network. The goal of the project is to reduce the duration time after the accident was done, to contact the emergency services. This document explains the high Level system design Architecture and Datasets.

# Required design:

UML Design

Step 1: Sample video is taken as input.

Step 2: Model shows whether there is accident or no accident. 

Step 3: If accident occurs. 

Step 4: If no accident occurs.

Step 5: Model display the accident message on screen. Step 6: Model display the no accident message on screen.

Step 7: Model will sound an alarm.

Step 8: The steps continue to run in a loop until the user closes the program.

# Datasets

•	Collected dataset from various sources and classifying into various category.

•	Collection of dataset from various legal sources.

•	And I collected some videos from the government of Telangana and some from you tube and trimmed the videos.

•	Collection of CCTV videos from various sources.

•	Divide the dataset into testing and training, Dataset collected is divided into two parts, 70% of dataset is training set and 30% is testing set.
